## Intelligence of Dogs

### Introduction
We all love dogs. Some more than others but all in all a dog is man's best friend. I think what we enjoy about our furry companions is their ability to learn. From just being able to fetch a ball and bring it back to helping police locate the missing to alerting their companion that they are about to have a seizure. Dogs are amazing animals.

### Research Questions
Studies have been done on which breeds are more intelligent than others, but I was curious about if a dogâ€™s weight has anything to do with how smart they are.  
- Are bigger dogs smarter than smaller dogs?
- Does the classification of a dog really tell their intelligence level?
- Does their heterozygosity have anything to do with their intelligence?
- Within a classification, do the larger breeds fair better than the smaller ones for intelligence?

### Approach
